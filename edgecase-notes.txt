DISPLAY CONNECTED OR DISCONNECTED:
- monitoring of backlight class using inotify
- gracefully terminates the related struct
- creates new struct on display connection

BRIGHTNESS OVERWRITTEN BY OTHER PROGRAM:
- only "corrects" on the next tick if brightness is higher than calculated (idle managers will often set brightness lower)
- headlight should be stopped if manually intervention is wanted
- IPC/control program will allow a temporary inhibit and override on a per display basis
