DISPLAY CONNECTED OR DISCONNECTED:
- monitoring of backlight class using inotify
- gracefully terminates the related struct
- creates new struct on display connection

BRIGHTNESS OVERWRITTEN BY OTHER PROGRAM:
- only "corrects" on the next tick if brightness is higher than calculated (idle managers will often set brightness lower)
- headlight should be stopped if manually intervention is wanted
- (IPC/control program will allow a temporary inhibit and override on a per display basis)

THREAD MODEL:
- Controller thread: manages backlight controllers, listens to update-events (by Sunrise thread or possible IPC program)
- inotify thread: watches /sys/class/backlight for changes
- Sunrise thread: calculates when to send an update to the Controller thread as well as the value (currently has to do a sleep -> check-time -> do-something-if -> repeat loop)
