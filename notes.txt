DISPLAY CONNECTED OR DISCONNECTED:
- monitoring of backlight class using inotify
- gracefully terminates the related struct
- creates new struct on display connection

BRIGHTNESS OVERWRITTEN BY OTHER PROGRAM:
- only "corrects" on the next tick if brightness is higher than calculated (idle managers will often set brightness lower)
- headlight should be stopped (systemctl, pkill, etc.) if manual intervention is wanted
- (IPC/control program will allow a temporary inhibit and override on a per display basis)

BRIGHTNESS CONTROLLERS:
- I might drop the modular model currently present, simply because I can focus on one interface that is the sysfs backlight class
- some drivers might already expose an external display on there
- the only other interface I'd maybe add is DDC anyway

SUNRISE CALCULATIONS:
- currently done by sunrise crate
- however, the returned DateTime is 1/1/1970 if the event does not happen on the same day
- so I might make my own library/crate (submodule for now), which differs in how it presents the calculation

THREAD MODEL:
- Controller thread: manages backlight controllers, listens to update-events (by Sunrise thread or possible IPC program)
- inotify thread: watches /sys/class/backlight for changes
- Sunrise thread: calculates when to send an update to the Controller thread as well as the value (currently has to do a sleep -> check-time -> do-something-if -> repeat loop)
